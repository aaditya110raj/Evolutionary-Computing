# GAP Solver with Approximation vs Optimal Comparison

This project addresses the **Generalized Assignment Problem (GAP)** using two different approaches:
1. A **Greedy Approximation Algorithm**.
2. Comparison with an **Optimal Solution** to analyze the **performance gap**.

## 🧩 Problem Description

The **Generalized Assignment Problem (GAP)** involves:
- Assigning a set of `tasks` to `agents`.
- Each assignment has an associated `benefit` and `resource requirement`.
- Each agent has a **capacity constraint**.

The objective is to **maximize the total benefit** without violating any agent's capacity.

## 🚀 Solution Approach

### ✅ Approximation Algorithm (Greedy)
- Assigns each task to the agent with **minimum cost or lowest utility loss**, considering capacity.
- Executed via the script `approximation.m`.

### 💯 Optimal Solution
- Results are precomputed and provided in `gap_max_results.csv`.
- Used for performance benchmarking against the greedy heuristic.

### 📊 Performance Gap Evaluation
The script `optimal_vs_approxin.m`:
- Merges greedy and optimal results.
- Computes:
  - **Approximation Ratio = Greedy / Optimal**
  - **Performance Gap = (1 - Ratio) * 100**
- Generates visualizations:
  - Utility comparison.
  - Boxplots and bar charts for multiple datasets.
  - Performance gaps (e.g., `gap12_comparison_gap.png`).

## 📉 Results Snapshot

For example, on dataset `gap12`:

| Instance | Optimal | Greedy | Gap (%) |
|----------|---------|--------|---------|
| c1       | 1450    | 812    | 44.0%   |
| c2       | 1450    | 836    | 42.4%   |
| c3       | 1450    | 846    | 41.7%   |
| c4       | 1450    | 835    | 42.5%   |
| c5       | 1450    | 851    | 41.4%   |

This highlights a **40–45% performance gap**, motivating exploration for better heuristics or hybrid methods.
